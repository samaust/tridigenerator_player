 * This file contains a fast, not so accurate integer implementation of the
 * forward DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform).
 *
 * A 2-D DCT can be done by 1-D DCT on each row followed by 1-D DCT
 * on each column.  Direct algorithms are also available, but they are
 * much more complex and seem not to be any faster when reduced to code.
 *
 * This implementation is based on Arai, Agui, and Nakajima's algorithm for
 * scaled DCT.  Their original paper (Trans. IEICE E-71(11):1095) is in
 * Japanese, but the algorithm is described in the Pennebaker & Mitchell
 * JPEG textbook (see REFERENCES section in file README).  The following code
 * is based directly on figure 4-8 in P&M.
 * While an 8-point DCT cannot be done in less than 11 multiplies, it is
 * possible to arrange the computation so that many of the multiplies are
 * simple scalings of the final outputs.  These multiplies can then be
 * folded into the multiplications or divisions by the JPEG quantization
 * table entries.  The AA&N method leaves only 5 multiplies and 29 adds
 * to be done in the DCT itself.
 * The primary disadvantage of this method is that with fixed-point math,
 * accuracy is lost due to imprecise representation of the scaled
 * quantization values.  The smaller the quantization table entry, the less
 * precise the scaled value, so this implementation does worse with high-
 * quality-setting files than with low-quality ones.

 *   Algorithms with 11 Multiplications", Proc. Int'l. Conf. on Acoustics,
 *   Speech, and Signal Processing 1989 (ICASSP '89), pp. 988-991.
 * The primary algorithm described there uses 11 multiplies and 29 adds.
 * We use their alternate method with 12 multiplies and 32 adds.
 * The advantage of this method is that no data path contains more than one
 * multiplication; this allows a very simple and accurate implementation in
 * scaled fixed-point arithmetic, with a minimal number of shifts.

 * is cumbersome, it's straightforward and the resulting code is much
 * faster.
 *
 * A better way to do this would be to pass in the DCT block as a sparse
 * matrix, perhaps with the difference cases encoded.
